## Repo Architecture

When I created this repo I only knew how to use notebooks and during my learning process I found out was easier to take micro-components and make it usable for creating more complex stuff like MLOps, so I moved all the root folder into [/notebooks](https://github.com/jchavezar/vertex-ai-samples/tree/main/notebooks)

*I'll keep this readme and my repo up to date "adding more stuff coming soon"*

**Following Diagram explains the repo by itself:**

failure to conquer hollywoodbr br by 1946 welles position as a hollywood figure was mixed citizen kane was not recognized as the great movie it has since been seen as due to the way it was attacked by the hearst press and by hollywood insiders themselves welles attempt at total control direction and production and acting of his movies seemed to threaten the whole system his best job in this period was as edward rochester in jane eyre supposedly shot by robert stevenson but actually shot in large measure with stevensons blessing by welles but the credit went to stevenson only the stranger a film

critical abilities by his production of around the world in 80 days but despite the assistance mike todd and cole porter composing the score the musical was a failure his failure occurred just at the

personal bankruptcy he sold his interest in the possible movie rights to around the world to todd which he would eventually rue and he also sold the idea of a film about the career of henri desire landru to charlie chaplin who was supposed to be directed in it and who turned it into monsieur verdouxbr br the story goes that welles with a 1000000 tax bill to worry about called cohn and offered to do a film with rita for a down payment cohn was willing to do so but naturally asked what the film was it was a wise question welles was on a pay phone in new york in a pharmacy that had a book department he grabbed a book with the title the lady from shanghai and raved that it was a great thriller somehow welles convinced the normally astute cohn that welles knew what he was talking about cohn said hed look into getting the rights and sent welles his downpayment of 1000000 after cohn hung up welles bought the book and read it and found it was really pretty bad he spent time rewriting a treatment and screenplay that would build up ritas character of elsa bannisterbr br certainly it has a curious plot development michael ohara is a seamanlongshoreman he rescues elsa bannister when she

as the skipper of their yacht the cruise also contains bannisters sinister partner george grisby glenn anders and one sidney broome ted de corsia who turns out to be a detective hired by bannister to watch elsa when they can michael and elsa try to find time together but broome or grisby keeps showing upbr br grisby makes michael an offer he wants for reasons connected to his socalled fatalistic view of modern society to drop out of it pretending to be dead according to grisby the plot becomes murky here he can still collect his life insurance although dead and use it to run off to the south seas he will pay michael 1000000 if he will pretend to shoot grisby this includes actually signing a document admitting to the murder michael does not realize that such an admission would wipe out the need to produce a corpse if all the other evidence suggests that grisby is probably deadbr br of course grisby is killed and michael is arrested for that and for the murder of broome shot with michaels gun michael is tried with bannister defending him and discovers that the latter is doing a second rate job because he wants michael to be convicted michael is convinced that bannister is the actual murderer and manages to escape just before the jury verdict he is knocked out and deposited in a deserted carnival and this leads to the famous fun house sequence and the conclusion of the filmbr br its a terribly confusing movie as i have had commented on that does not mean its not worth seeing visually it is striking witness the fight between michael and the police in the trial judges quarters where he knocks the bailiff into the judges bookcase shattering glass or the clever use of photography to capture hayworth diving from a rock reflected on the lecherous grisbys binocularsbr br the acting is pretty good in particular sloane possibly that fine actors best film role glenn anders was a leading broadway performer he rarely made movies before the lady from shanghai and his slimy grisby is unforgettable also ted de corsia does very nicely with broome a detective who is really looking for his own interests to his own costbr br as for hayworth she turns in a performance that was unlike most of what she had done before blood and sand tales of manhattan and the strawberry blond are exceptions and is a memorable siren welles ohara is a very unusual character for the

original theatrical previews of other italian horror classics like spasmo and beyond the darkness unfortunately the previews were the best thing about this moviebr br zombi 3 in a bizarre way is actually linked to the infamous lucio fulci zombie franchise which began in 1979 similarly compared to zombie zombi 3 consists of a threadbare plot and a handful of extremely bad actors that keeps this horror trash barely afloat the gore is nearly nonexistent unless one is frightened of people running around with green moss on their faces and the english dubbing is a notch below embarrassingbr br the plot this time around involves some sort of covert military operation with a bunch of inept scientists ie an idiotic male and his stupid female sidekick who are developing some sort of chemical called death one that is supposed to reanimate the dead unless my ears need to be checked i dont even recall a reason for the research of death one it seems to exist only to wreak havoc upon the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to star in this cinematic laughfestbr br anyway death one is experimented on a corpse whom i swear looked like yul brynner and after it is injected into his system he sits upright and his head explodes the sound effects are also quite hilarious as the corpses face bubbles with green slime the sound of paper crumpling can be heard the death one toxin is transported outside and is hijacked by a group of thieves where one makes off with it but infects himself after cutting himself on an exposed vialbr br needless to say the guy turns into a zombie but not before he makes his timely escape to a cheap motel infects a lowly porter and murders a maid by pushing her face into a bathroom mirror the military catch wind of this and immediately take action before eliminating everyone who is unlucky enough to be within the contamination zone and turn the motel upside down they find the infected thief and burn his body only to have the smoke infect a flock of birds that are flying over the chimney stackbr br we cut to the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the army listening to groovy music that is coming out of a little dinky boombox while trailing a trailerload of slutty girls who are leaning out of the windows and showing off their chests can someone say zombie food we also have a subplot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to inspect a group of birds lying on the road the same birds that were infected by the zombie smoke br br the birds attack the boyfriend and the girl drives off to a deserted gas station to seek water this is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments of the movie she walks around this old dirty rusty and obviously abandoned building where she continues to ask aloud hello is there anyone here please i just need some water she encounters a group of zombies one of which is chained to a wall and the other is swinging a machete after a bit of rumbling and tumbling around on the ground she escapes but not before blowing up the gas station with her lighterbr br meanwhile the birds attack the trailerload of whores and one girl gets pecked and infected they all pull up to the same motel where the original infection took place and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film takes place after a matter of hours a day at the most the same motel is now caked in dust has vines growing throughout it and looks like it has been sitting derelict for years anyway what better place to take refuge than this particular building needless to say the group begins to break down as several people walk off together to get themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attackbr br the third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman who explore a deserted village of which the woman comments this place is a dump she then proceeds to get pushed off a balcony by a zombie into pirahna infested water where she has her legs bitten off and turns into a zombie within seconds meanwhile her friend back at the motel who got pecked and infected hours earlier is still turning into a zombiebr br unfortunately there are just too many inconsistencies in this movie that makes this movie just too stupid for words for example the time rate concerning infected people being zombified differs greatly sometimes it takes seconds other times it takes hours some zombies run others drag their feet and walk really slow some even do kungfu moves while others hide under stacks of hay to surprise people some of the zombies even talk the funniest moment of course is the infamous zombie head in the fridge gag which elevates itself in midair and attacks a stupid man who goes looking for food funnily enough his girlfriend gets her throat torn out by its headless counterpart lmaobr br the biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of storylines involving the people who are in fact killed by zombies we never get to see them come back as zombies in fact the only ones we do see zombified are the ones pecked by the birds and the one girl who gets her legs bitten off other than that i was at least expecting the couple who were killed in the kitchen andor the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as zombies it is also amazing that these zombies only take a few bites and then move on to their next victim br br the most laughable moment was of course the zombie fetus a pregnant woman who has been infected lies on a bed in a hospital a woman who seems to have a lot of medical knowledge tries to deliver the baby and has her face pulled off by a zombie before having her head pushed into the womans stomach where a hand bursts out and proceeds to rip the rest of her face off timelessbr br as usual all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre the megalomaniacal military officer the pathetic useless squealing women who scream to get killed the obvious characters who are about to get killed ie watch for the man chasing a chicken i guess this movie really is a comedy there were many laughable scenes such as the shed that gets blown up with a hand grenade obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent and a climatic scene where a man screams im thirsty thirsty for your blood the costumes are really bad the same zombies reappear throughout the course of the film wearing the same asianlike clothing that may be found in a bruce lee film and watch out for the blue 60s skirt the girl at the motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend bump into the infected manbr br the end of the film leaves open the door as usual for the apocalyptic storyline a radio dj who narrates throughout the whole movie turns out to be a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the beginning of the end while the two survivors take off in a helicopter hardly dawn of the dead material if you ask mebr br regardless this movie does deliver many laughs the gore is minimal and what gore there is it is very unconvincing let alone unimaginative the usual mix of black blood thick green goo oozing out of weeping sores and zombie makeup consisting of green moss zombi 3 makes for a good rental for a sleepover party or a night of beer and popcorn other than that horror fans should stay awaybr br 3 out of 10", "dataItemResourceLabels": {"aiplatform.googleapis.com/ml_use": "test"}}

Followingout this intention, he wrote a play on ambition and itsdangers, and another of the same kind on jealousy andall the evils that attend it. But that is not how thingshappen in the inner life of a creative spirit. A poetdoes not write exercises on a given subject. Hisactivity is not the result of determination or choice.A nerve in him is touched, vibrates, and re-acts.What Shakespeare here attempts to realise is neitherjealousy nor credulity, but simply and solely thetragedy of life; whence does it arise? what are itscauses? what its laws?He was deeply impressed with the power and signi-ficance of evil. Othello is much less a study of jealousythan a new and more powerful study of wickedness inits might.The umbilical cord that connects themaster with his work leads, not to the character ofOthello, but to that of Iago.Simple-minded critics have been of opinion thatShakespeare constructed Iago on the lines of thehistoric Richard III.-that is to say, found him inliterature, in the pages of a chronicler.Believe me, Shakespeare met Iago in his own life,\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n", "9": "vi\nOTHELLO.\nsaw portions and aspects of him on every handthroughout his manhood, encountered him piecemeal,as it were, on his daily path, till one fine day, whenhe thoroughly felt and understood what malignantcleverness and baseness can effect, he melted down allthese fragments, and out of them cast this figure.Iago there is more of the grand manner in thisfigure than in the whole of Macbeth. Iago-there ismore depth, more penetrating knowledge of humannature in this one character than in the whole ofMacbeth. Iago is the very embodiment of the grand\nmanner.\nHe is not the principle of evil, not an old-fashioned,stupid devil; nor a Miltonic devil, who loves inde-pendence and has invented firearms; nor a Goethe'sMephistopheles, who talks cynicism, makes himselfindispensable, and is generally in the right. Neither hashe the magnificently foolhardy wickedness of a C\u00e6sarBorgia, who lives his life in open defiance and recklessatrocity.Iago has no other aim than his own advantage. Itis the circumstance that not he, but Cassio, has beenappointed second in command to Othello, which firstsets his craft to work on subtle combinations. Hecoveted this post, and he will stick at nothing in orderto win it. In the meantime, he takes advantage ofevery opportunity of profit that offers itself; he doesnot hesitate to fool Roderigo out of his money andhis jewels. He is always masked in falsehood andhypocrisy; and the mask he has chosen is the mostimpenetrable one, that of rough outspokenness, thestraightforward, honest bluntness of the soldier whodoes not care what others think or say of him. Henever flatters Othello or Desdemona, or even Roderigo.He is the free-spoken, honest friend.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n", "10": "INTRODUCTION.\nvii\nHe does not seek his own advantage without side-glances at others. He is mischievousness personified.He does evil for the pleasure of hurting, and takesactive delight in the adversity and anguish of others.He is that eternal envy which merit or success in othersnever fails to irritate-not the petty envy which iscontent with coveting another's honours or possessions,or with holding itself more deserving of another's goodfortune. No; he is an ideal personification. He isblear-eyed rancour itself, figuring as a great power-nay, as the motive force-in human life. He embodiesthe detestation for others' excellences which showsitself in obstinate disbelief, suspicion, or contempt; theinstinct of hatred for all that is open, beautiful, bright,good, and great.\n-\nII.\nruns\nIn Cinthio's Italian collection of tales, where he hadfound the plot of Measure for Measure, Shakespeare atthe same time (in Decade 3, Novella 7) came upon thematerial for Othello. The story in the Hecatommittias follows:-A young Venetian lady namedDisdemona falls in love with a Moor, a military com-mander-'not from feminine desire,' but because ofhis great qualities and marries him in spite of theopposition of her relatives. They live in Venice incomplete happiness; 'no word ever passed betweenthem that was not loving.' When the Moor is orderedto Cyprus to take command there, his one anxiety isabout his wife; he is equally unwilling to expose herto the dangers of the sea voyage and to leave her alone.She settles the question by declaring that she willrather follow him anywhere, into any danger, than livein safety apart from him; whereupon he rapturously\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n", "11": "viii\nOTHELLO.\nness.'\nkisses her, with the ejaculation, 'May God long pre-serve you so loving, my dearest wife!' Thus the perfectinitial harmony between the pair which Shakespearedepicts is suggested by his original.The Ensign undermines their happiness. He isdescribed as remarkably handsome, but 'as wicked bynature as any man that ever lived in the world.' Hewas dear to the Moor, who had no idea of his base-For although he was an arrant coward, hemanaged by means of proud and blusterous talk, aidedby his fine appearance, so to conceal his cowardice thathe passed for a Hector or Achilles. His wife, whom hehad taken with him to Cyprus, was a fair and virtuousyoung woman, much beloved by Disdemona, who spentthe greater part of the day in her company. TheLieutenant (il capo di squadra) came much to the Moor'shouse, and often supped with him and his wife.The wicked Ensign is passionately in love withDisdemona, but all his attempts to win her love areentirely unsuccessful, as she has not a thought for anyone but the Moor. The Ensign, however, imagines thatthe reason for her rejection of him must be that she isin love with the Lieutenant, and therefore determinesto rid himself of this rival, while his love for Disdemonais changed into the bitterest hatred. From this timeforward, his object is not only to bring about the deathof the Lieutenant, but to prevent the Moor from findingthe pleasure in Disdemona's love which is denied tohimself. He goes to work as in the drama, though ofcourse with some differences of detail. In the novel,for example, the Ensign steals Disdemona's handker-chief while she is visiting his wife, and playing withtheir little girl.Disdemona's death-scene is morehorrible in the tale than in the tragedy. By commandof the Moor, the Ensign hides himself in a room\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n", "12": "INTRODUCTION.\nix\n.\nadjoining Othello's and Disdemona's bedchamber. Hemakes a noise, and Disdemona rises to see what it is;whereupon the Ensign gives her a violent blow on thehead with a stocking filled with sand. She calls to herhusband for help, but he answers by accusing her ofinfidelity; she in vain protests her innocence, and diesat the third blow of the stocking. The murder is con-cealed, but the Moor now begins to hate his Ensign,and dismisses him. The Ensign is so exasperated bythis, that he lets the Lieutenant know who is responsiblefor the night assault that has just been made upon him.The Lieutenant accuses the Moor before the council,and Othello is put to torture.He refuses to confess,and is sent into banishment. The wicked Ensign, whohas brought a false accusation of murder against one ofhis comrades, is himself in turn accused by the innocentman, and subjected to torture until he dies.To the characters in the novel, Shakespeare hasadded two, Brabantio and Roderigo. Only one of thenames he uses is found in the original. Disdemona,which seems made to designate the victim of an evildestiny, Shakespeare has changed into the sweeter-sounding Desdemona. The other names are of Shake-speare's own choosing. Most of them are Italian(Othello itself is a Venetian noble name of the six-teenth century); others, such as Iago and Roderigo,are Spanish.With his customary adherence to his original, Shake-speare, like Cinthio, calls his protagonist a Moor; butit is quite unreasonable to suppose from this that hethought of him as a negro. It was, of course, incon-ceivable that a negro should attain the rank of generaland admiral in the service of the Venetian Republic;and Iago's mention of Mauritania as the country towhich Othello intends to retire, shows plainly enough\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n", "13": "OTHELLO.\n,\nthat the 'Moor' ought to be represented as an Arab.It is no argument against this that men who hate andenvy him apply to him epithets that would befit a negro.Thus Roderigo in the first scene of the play calls him'thick-lips,' and lago, speaking to Brabantio, calls him\u2018an old black ram.But a little later Iago compareshim with \u2018a Barbary horse'- that is to say, an Arabfrom North Africa. It is always animosity and hatethat exaggerate the darkness of his hue, as whenBrabantio talks of his 'sooty bosom.' That Othellocalls himself black only means that he is dark. In thisvery play Iago says of dark women:'If she be black, and thereto have a wit,She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.'\nIt may be noticed that, in the Sonnets and in Love'sLabour's Lost, 'black' is constantly employed in thesense of dark-complexioned. As a Moor, Othello hasa complexion sufficiently swarthy to form a strikingcontrast to the white and even blonde Desdemona, andthere is also a sufficiently marked race-contrast betweenhim, as a Semite, and the Aryan girl. It is quite con-ceivable, too, that a Christianised Moor should reach ahigh position in the army and fleet of the Republic.Othello's is an inartificial soul, a simple, straight-forward, soldier nature. He has no worldly wisdom,for he has lived his whole life in camps:\u2018And little of this great world can I speak,More than pertains to feats of broil and battle.'A good and true man himself, he believes in goodnessin others, especially in those who make a show of out-spokenness, bluffness, undaunted determination toblame where blame is due-like Iago, who character-istically says of himself to Desdemona:\n'For I am nothing, if not critical.'\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n", "14": "INTRODUCTION.\nxi\nAnd Othello not only believes in Iago's honesty, butis inclined to take him for his guide, as being farsuperior to himself in knowledge of men and of theworld.Again, Othello belongs to the noble natures that arenever preoccupied with the thought of their own worth.He is devoid of vanity. He has never said to himselfthat such exploits, such heroic deeds, as have won himhis renown, must make a far deeper impression on thefancy of a young girl of Desdemona's disposition thanthe smooth face and pleasant manners of a Cassio. Heis so little impressed with the idea of his greatness thatit almost at once appears quite natural to him that heshould be scorned.His speech of self-vindication in the council-chamber,in which he explains to the Duke how he came to winDesdemona's sympathy and tenderness, has been univer-sally admired.Having gained her father's favour, he was often askedby him to tell the story of his life, of its dangers andadventures. He told of sufferings and hardships, ofhairbreadth 'scapes from death, of imprisonment bycruel enemies, of far-off strange countries he hadjourneyed through. (The fantastic catalogue, it may benoted, is taken from the fabulous books of travel of theday.) Desdemona loved to listen, but was often calledaway by household cares, always returning when thesewere despatched to follow his story with a greedy ear.He found means' to draw from her a request to tellher his history, not in fragments, but entire. He con-sented, and often her eyes were filled with tears whenshe heard of the distresses of his youth. With inno-cent candour she bade him at last, if ever he had afriend that loved her, to teach him how to tell herOthello's story-' and that would woo her.'\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n", "15": "xii\nOTHELLO.\nIn other words, she is not won through the eye,though we must take Othello to have been a statelyfigure, but through the ear: 'I saw Othello's visage inhis mind.' She becomes his through her sympathywith him in all he has suffered and achieved :-\n'She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,And I loved her that she did pity them.This only is the witchcraft I have used. . . .DUKE. I think this tale would win my daughter too.\"Such, then, is the relation in which the poet has decreedthat these two shall stand to each other.This is nolove between two of the same age and the same race,whom only family enmity keeps apart, as in Romeo andJuliet. Still less is it a union of hearts like that ofBrutus and Portia, where the perfect harmony is theresult of tenderest friendship in combination withclosest kinship, added to the fact that the wife's fatheris her husband's hero and ideal. No; in direct con-trast to this last, it is a union which rests on theattraction of opposites, and which has everythingagainst it-difference of race, difference of age, and thestrange, exotic aspect of the man, with the lack of self-confidence which it awakens in him.Iago expounds to Roderigo how impossible it is thatthis alliance should last. Desdemona fell in love withthe Moor because he bragged to her and told herfantastical lies; does any one believe that love can bekept alive by prating? To inflame the blood anew,\"sympathy in years, manners, and beauties' is required,'all which the Moor is defective in.'The Moor himself is at first troubled by none of thesereflections. And why not? Because Othello is notjealous.This sounds paradoxical, yet it is the plain truth.Othello not jealous! It is as though one were to say\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n", "16": "INTRODUCTION.\nxiii\nwater is not wet or fire does not burn. But Othello's isno jealous nature; Jealous men and women think verydifferently and act very differently. He is unsuspicious,confiding, and in so far stupid-there lies the misfor-tune; but jealous, in the proper sense of the word, heis not. When Iago is preparing to insinuate his calum-nies of Desdemona, he begins hypocritically (iii. 3) :-\n-\n\u2018O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;It is the green-eyed monster . .\nOthello answers:\n\u201dTis not to make me jealousTo say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well 1;Where virtue is, these are more virtuous :Nor from mine own weak merits will I drawThe smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;For she had eyes, and chose me.'\nThus not even his exceptional position causes him anyuneasiness, so long as things take their natural course.But there is no escaping the steady pursuit of which he,all unwitting, is the object. He becomes as suspicioustowards Desdemona as he is credulous towards Iago-'Brave Iago!' 'Honest Iago!' Brabantio's malisonrecurs to his mind-'She has deceived her father, andmay thee'; and close on it crowd Iago's reasons:\n'Haply, for I am blackAnd have not those soft parts of conversationThat chamberers have, or for I am declinedInto the vale of years, yet that's not much.\u201d\nAnd the torment seizes him of feeling that one humanbeing is a sealed book to the other-that it is impos-sible to control passion and appetite in a woman, thoughthe law may have given her into one's hands-until atlast he feels as if he were stretched on the rack, and\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n", "17": "xiv\nOTHELLO.\nIago can e ult in the thought that not all the drowsysyrups of the world can procure him the untroubledsleep of yesterday. Then follows the mournful fare-well to all his previous life, and on this sadness oncemore follows doubt, and despair at the doubt :-\n'I think my wife be honest and think she is not;I think that thou art just and think thou art not,'\n\u2014until all his thoughts are centred in the craving forrevenge and blood.\nNot naturally jealous, he has become so through theworking of the base but devilishly subtle slander whichhe is too simple to penetrate and spurn.It is not, indeed, Othello's jealousy, but his credulity,that is the prime cause of the disaster; and even somust Desdemona's noble simplicity bear its share inthe blame. Between them they render possible thecomplete success of a man like Iago.The figure of Desdemona is one of the most charmingShakespeare has drawn. She is more womanly thanother women, as the noble Othello is more manly thanother men.So that after all there is a very good reasonfor the attraction between them; the most womanly ofwomen feels herself drawn to the manliest of men.The subordinate figures are worked out with hardlyless skill than the principal characters of the tragedy.Emilia especially is inimitable-good-hearted, honest,and not exactly light, but still sufficiently the daughterof Eve to be unable to understand Desdemona's na\u00efveand innocent chastity.At the end of Act iv. (in the bedroom scene) Desde-mona asks Emilia if she believes that there really arewomen who do what Othello accuses her of. Emiliaanswers in the affirmative. Then her mistress asksagain: 'Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?'\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n", "18": "INTRODUCTION.\nXV\nand receives the jesting answer, 'The world's a hugething it is a great price for a small vice:\n'Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, norfor measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps,nor any petty exhibition; but, for the whole world! . . .Why, the wrong is but a wrong i\u0307' the world; and, havingthe world for your labour, 'tis a wrong in your own world,and you might quickly make it right.'\nInpassageslike this a mildly playful note is struckin theverymidst of the horror. And according to hishabit and the custom of the times, Shakespeare alsointroduces, by means of the Clown, one or two deliber-ately comic passages; but the Clown's merriment issubdued, as Shakespeare's merriment at this periodalways is.The composition of Othello is closely akin to that ofMacbeth. In these two tragedies alone there are noepisodes; the action moves onward uninterrupted andundissipated. But the beautiful proportion of all itsparts and articulations gives Othello the advantage overthe mutilated Macbeth which we possess.Here thecrescendo of the tragedy is executed with absolutemaestria; the passion rises with a positively musicaleffect; Iago's devilish plan is realised step by step withconsummate certainty; all details are knit togetherone firm and wellnigh inextricable knot; and thecarelessness with which Shakespeare has treated thenecessary lapse of time between the different stages ofthe action, has, by compressing the events of monthsand years into a few days, heightened the effect ofstrict and firm cohesion which the play produces.Othello is the only one of Shakespeare's tragedieswhich does not treat of national events, but is a familytragedy-what was later known as trag\u00e9die domestiqueor bourgeoise. But the treatment is anything but\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n", "19": "xvi\nOTHELLO.\nbourgeois; the style is of the very grandest. One getsthe best idea of the distance between it and the trag\u00e9diebourgeoise of later times on comparing with it Schiller'sKabale und Liebe, which is in many ways an imitationof Othello.We see here a great man who is at the same time agreat child; a noble though impetuous nature, as un-suspicious as it is unworldly. We see a young woman,all gentleness and nobility of heart, who lives only forhim she has chosen, and who dies with solicitude forher murderer on her lips. And we see these two electnatures ruined by the simplicity which makes them aneasy prey to wickedness.A great work Othello undoubtedly is, but it is a mono-graph. It lacks the breadth which Shakespeare's playsas a rule possess. It is a sharply limited study of asingle and very special form of passion, the growth ofsuspicion in the mind of a lover with African blood andtemperament a great example of the power of wicked-ness over unsuspecting nobility. Taken all in all, thisis a restricted subject, which becomes monumental onlyby the grandeur of its treatment.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n", "20": "OTHELLO,\nTHE MOOR OF VENICE.\nPERSONS REPRESENTED.\nDUKE OF VENICE.\nBRABANTIO, a senator.\nOther SENATORS.\nGRATIANO, brother to Brabantio.LODOVICO, kinsman to Brabantio.OTHELLO, a noble Moor in the service of the Venetian\nstate.\nCASSIO, his lieutenant.IAGO, his ancient.RODERIGO, a Venetian gentleman.MONTANO, Othello's predecessor in the government ofCyprus.CLOWN, servant to Othello.\nDESDEMONA, daughter to Brabantio and wife toOthello.EMILIA, wife to Iago.BIANCA, mistress to Cassio.\nSailor, Messenger, Herald, Officers, Gentlemen,Musicians, and Attendants.\nScene-Venice: a Sea-port in Cyprus.\nB\n.\nDigitized by\nGoogle\n", "21": "Digitized by\nGoogle\n", "22": ":\nOTHELLO,\nTHE MOOR OF VENICE.\nACT THE FIRST.\nSCENE I.\nVenice.
